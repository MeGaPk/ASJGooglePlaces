# ASJGooglePlaces
This library is a collection of classes that act as a wrapper around a few features of the Google Places API and the Directions API. Note that to use Google's Places API in your project, you need to have an API key grom the [API console](https://code.google.com/apis/console). You can however use the Directions API without a key. In the example project, it has been used to display a polyline between two places. You will need an API key to run the example project. You can fetch the following place information using these classes:

- Place ID
- Place details
- Place photos
- Autocomplete
- Directions
